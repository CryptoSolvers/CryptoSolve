# Libraries for Symbolic Methods

To get started you should make sure that your environment is setup.

<u>Create a virtual environment</u>

```bash
python3 -m venv senv
```

<u>Set your terminal session to use that environment</u>

```bash
source senv/bin/activate
```

<u>Install Required Dependencies</u>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the examples! In the future, don't forget to `source` the environment every time you open a new terminal session.

## Libraries Included

### Algebra

A free algebra library that only exists as a way to encode equations such as `f(x) = 5` for later use in the other libraries.
