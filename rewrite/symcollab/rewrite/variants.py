    Construct variants of a term given a rewrite system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    term : Term
       The term to compute the variants from.
    rules : RewriteSystem
       The rules from which to compute the variants from.

    Notes
    -----
    A variant of a term $t$ is a term that can be obtained by applying
    a sequence of rewrite rules to $t$.
